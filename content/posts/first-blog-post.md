I finally set up my blog. This is meant to be a space where people can find the up-to-date list of my contacts and some information about me and my work. I will also use the blog to write about whatever i feel like sharing. This includes Monero and other cryptocurrencies, but also opinions and analysis on politics and technology.

In the [About](/about/) section there are some info about me and what i do.

See you around!
